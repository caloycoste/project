                    <p class="blog-content">In Evan Selinger’s  article Will Tech Companies Ever Take Ethics Seriously? published on Medium, he confronts about the importance of ethics– the discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation– in big tech companies for producing products and services responsible for possible data exploitation. He points out three largest ethics gaps that big tech companies have to improve: ethics in design, ethics training and procedures at work, and ethics education and policy at school. Ethics in design focuses on how the products are ethically made including the platform power and implementation of safety and privacy. Ethics training and procedures at work involves proper ethics training program for employees to exercise ethical decision-making. Ethics education and policy at school prepares future professionals to be committed to ideal information justice before they go to their first jobs as data scientists and engineers.

        <br><br>After the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal where Cambridge Analytica illegally collected millions of Facebook personal data for political advertising purposes on 2018, Zuckerberg called it a breach of trust and promised to reform Facebook policy. Several privacy laws have been enforced through the years by data protection authorities, however, data breaches still occur even in third-party applications. Because of this, it is suggested to add stronger force in implementing such laws. It is a wise idea to act upon, but lawmakers and big tech companies only focus on implementing rules for data processing and ignore the rest that needs to be considered, such as ethics.

        <br><br>As the world go through the information age, it needs good role models who will take a stand to information justice and data protection. These role models are expected to have undergone good ethics curricula or have learned how to think in novel and creative ways in philosophy for thought experiment before finishing a degree. Being a good role model in the information age is an early process of learning to choose ethical decisions and creating a connection between what they preach and what they practice. Good role models in the work place make ethically concerned employees and advocates for the public good. While ethics are to be taught well on future leaders and data scientists and engineers, ethics in big tech companies is a dual performance. Big tech companies have to consider it more seriously if they want to gain a huge amount of public trust. They have to listen to their employees who acknowledges that there is a loose approach when it comes to implementing data processing and privacy guidelines on their products and services. In fact, consumers look forward to big tech companies to produce products and services they feel the most secured environment.</p>

                    <h2>The Human Skills We Need in an Unpredictable World</h2>

                    <p class="blog-content">Margaret Heffernan gave a number of great points on her talk about The Human Skills We Need in an Unpredictable World. However, the three key insights that hit me the most are: one, efficiency works really well when you can predict what exactly are you going to need; two, we outsource to machine what we could do ourselves; three, what’s left out is everything that can’t be measured, which is actually something that counts. Efficiency myth creates standardized work for a predictable reality, which raises a question to unpredictable ones. The world is an infinite collection of possibilities and having to envision all of them to create an efficient system to work sounds exhausting to me. The world needs the human skills and proper intellect back. We build machines to do the things humans can do with their bodies. Instead of trying to be better on the skills we already have or discovering skills we never thought we have, we are too busy discovering and making machines to be better, making us less skilled. Dependence in technology is what defines survival now. Again, the world is getting worse and it wants its humans to be ready on what’s to come. Through the years, we have lost the spirit of coalition-building that allows us to make friends and build solidarity because we are so focused on building systems that might help us in the future. It can’t be measured by efficiency but it is something that counts if we are to talk about global change. Technology can help, but building a skilled nation is a preparation for facing an unpredictable world.

        <br><br>Truthfully, Heffernan’s points only fed my fear of losing humanity in a world where humans are intended to enjoy their lifetime together. As a student who might be an electronics engineer in the future, I know the chances that the world is going to face the technology age where humans are forced to live in complete dependence on artificially intelligent machines in order to survive. I know what engineers are capable to do with enough knowledge and resources, and I’m afraid that this age already lies somewhere within their grasp. So as an electronics engineer in the Philippines, I would want to put efficiency on the idea of people working with people. I would want to see us explore our abilities while building relationships with another. I acknowledge that people needs an inspiration for change, and if that means changing my attitude to be mindful whether in workplace or not, I would be grateful to challenge myself. I see efficiency when people work together and give better results. I see no waste of time on passing on an amount of strength from one person to another because strength leads to bravery, and bravery to change. Our preparedness to face an unpredictable world is not identified by technology but by our own ability to adapt. In order for us to adapt, we need to be a little more human and a lot less technology-dependent.</p>
